# SEOptimization
* In this challenge, I edited the index.html file to include semantic elements that gave the code order and structure. I also ensured that the CSS docuement was changed where neccasary to hold the page layout considering the changes made to the corresponding html file.

## Instructions

I worked by myself and considered the following user story:

* As a marketing agency I WANT a codebase that followes accessibility standards SO THAT our own site is optimizd for search engines

## Acceptance Criteria

* GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
* WHEN I view the source code
* THEN I find semantic HTML elements
* WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
* THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of   styling and positioning
* WHEN I view the image elements
* THEN I find accessible alt attributes
* WHEN I view the heading attributes
* THEN they fall in sequential order
* WHEN I view the title element
* THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

## ðŸ’¡ Notes
* Work on your code in a repository and clone the main branch from GitHub
* Make sure the application loads with no errors
* Make sure the format of the webpage does not change after changing the semantic elements on the index.html file
* Check the css file while fixing bugs to ensure the name of the elements still match with the index.html file after changing the divs to semantic elements
* Deploy the website using pages on GitHub
